## Overview

  This project is basically an upgrade to my previous chat app project [see here](https://github.com/ikennaezef/worldie-chat-test/). In this version, users can communicate in different rooms according to topics associated with the rooms - sports, music, technology, etc. This feature is enabled by react router. The app also comes with an authentication process which includes authentication by username and password and also authentication with google via your google account. This feature is enabled by firebase, which includes its own authentication feature. The application also includes theming , that is, users can switch between themes according to their choice. The existing themes are the blue, green and dark themes. This theming feature is enabled by styled components

### What I learned

This has been my biggest project so far and it was quite a step up in difficulty from its predecessor. It was a challenging process but it was well worth it and satisfying in the end. I'm getting more accustomed and comfortable with firebase and it's features. I'm really happy with the UI as I came up with all the designs and layout myself.
I'm looking foward to doing more projects.
